# Predicting Emergency Service Demands in Toronto

## Overview

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

This repository analyzes paramedic incident data from Open Data Toronto to uncover trends in emergency response patterns. The study investigates how time-based factors such as year, month, day of the week, and hour influence the frequency and nature of incidents. By using historical data from 2017 to 2022, the project aims to identify patterns in service demand and provide insights to optimize resource allocation in Toronto. The analysis also examines variations in incident priorities and response metrics, supporting data-driven decision-making to improve paramedic service efficiency and outcomes.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:
-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from OpenDataToronto.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
